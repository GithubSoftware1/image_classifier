# image_classifier in your browser 

## Introduction 
This is a very simple image classifier. What is interesting about this particular one is the fact it is done in the browser.

## Installation 
There are no dependencies and there are only two files needed to run it. The first is the HTML file which you would need to open in your browser 

## Tips & Trick 
You will have to allow your browser to access your Webcam and obviously you would need a webcam on your machine. Chrome worked for me and I did not investigate further to see why it would not work in some of the other browsers.
